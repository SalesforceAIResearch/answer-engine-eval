# Answer Engine (RAG) Evaluation 

Answer Engines powered by Generative AI are reshaping how people access and interact with global knowledge and online information. This repository provides the code and data necessary to reproduce our experimental results in this area, advancing research on the evaluation of Answer Engines and their underlying RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

## Ethical Considerations
This release is for research purposes only in support of an academic paper. Our models, datasets, and code are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. We strongly recommend users evaluate and address potential concerns related to accuracy, safety, and fairness before deploying this model. We encourage users to consider the common limitations of AI, comply with applicable laws, and leverage best practices when selecting use cases, particularly for high-risk scenarios where errors or misuse could significantly impact peopleâ€™s lives, rights, or safety. For further guidance on use cases, refer to our AUP and AI AUP.
