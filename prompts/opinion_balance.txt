You are given a query that is opinionated (on one side of an issue). You are then given a numbered list of statements.
Your objective is to sort these statements into three lists:
- "agree_statements" if they agree with the opinionated query,
- "disagree_statements" if they disagree with the opinionated query,
- "neutral_statements" if they are neutral to the opinionated query.

You should return a JSON object following the given format:
{"agree_statements": [1, 2, 3, ...], "disagree_statements": [4, 5, 6, ...], "neutral_statements": [7, 8, 9, ...]}

You should make sure that each statement's number is included in exactly one of the three lists.

Query:
[[QUERY]]

Statements:
[[STATEMENTS]]

Remember to follow the format given above, only output JSON.
