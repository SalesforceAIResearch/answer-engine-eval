You are given a paragraph, made of a sequence of sentences that answer the following question:
[[QUESTION]]

Your task is to extract, in JSON format, what the individual sentences are, and then identify for each sentence whether it contains a core statement that answers the question, or if it is a filler sentence that does not contain substantial information.
You should follow the following format:
{"sentences":
    {"sentence": "...", "core": "1|0"},
    {"sentence": "...", "core": "1|0"},
}

Rules:
- Do not modify the sentences whatsoever, you should copy them as is.
- Do not modify the order of the sentences, or skip any of the sentences.
- The sentences optionally contain citations (e.g. [1], [2], etc.). You should not modify the citations, keep them as is.
- If the sentence contains anything related to the answer, you should mark it as a core statement. Sentences with a citation are almost always core statements.
- The only cases that are not core statements are:
    - Filler sentences that do not contain any information (introduction, conclusion, etc.)
