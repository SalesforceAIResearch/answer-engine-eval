You are given the full text of a document, and a statement (a sentence). Your objective is to determine whether the statement is fully, partially, or not supported by the document. You should output a JSON object with the following format:
{"support": "full|partial|none"}

Document:
```
[[DOCUMENT]]
```

Statement:
[[STATEMENT]]

Rules:
- The statement may contain citations (e.g. [1], [2], etc.). You do not need to consider the citations when determining support.
- Only output valid JSON. Do not include any other information in the output.
